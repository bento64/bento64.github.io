      <description>Howdy,
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last website/blog worked on GitHub Pages. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel proud of it anyways.
I was really busy for a lot of classes just to make it into a local city university, but hey things are going fine so far. Everyone is very friendly here (well, most of the time).
Before I made it here, I expected to be a CS student as I really love computer and want to study how it works.</description>
