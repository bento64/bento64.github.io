Howdy,

It's been a while since my last website/blog worked on GitHub Pages. I didn't feel proud of it anyways.

I was really busy for a lot of classes just to make it into a local city university, but hey things are going fine so far. Everyone is very friendly here (well, most of the time).

Before I made it here, I expected to be a CS student as I really love computer and want to study how it works. Turned out my entrance exam grades weren't enough for CS, but CE (I'll explain more later). But hey it was a luck for me! CE here is deeply focus on making hardware and working with it by writing (low level) software. Meanwhile CS (at least here) only focus on studying computer software and it's applications. Apparently it's a blessing in disguise.

At the time of writing this post, I have done 45% journey of a freshman, that's roughly 5.55555...5% of my undergraduate journey. Things are still really hard for a freshman anyways.

I'd use English as primary language on my website, I'm still studying it hardly but there will be a Vietnamese version of it for my friends, collegemates, lecturers and fellows can easily read what I write.

Below is a simply C code snippet for... illustration purposes ;)

```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    main(){
        printf("Hello world!\n");
    }
```
