I have 3 email accounts, each of them is used for particular purposes only.

* Personal email: for general contact purposes e.g. business inquiries, employment, initial contact to other platforms, etc. You can only use either English or Vietnamese.
```
trungnhan6143[at]gmail[dot]com
```

* Work email: mostly for hobby and collaborating to projects (i.e. git). You **must** use English, I will reject any email written in any other language than English, including Vietnamese. I do not care about spelling or grammar faults but the sent email has to be in English (Bạn **phải sử dụng** tiếng Anh khi liên lạc qua địa chỉ này).
```
ben​to64[at]​di​sroot​[dot]​org
```

* School email: only for internal use and cross-school contact (scholarship, research, student exchange, etc.). You can use any language, but I can only read English and Vietnamese.
```

```
When in doubt, use the first one.

I always sign my email with OpenPGP key, you can import my public key from Ubuntu PGP Keyserver: [CF044E72D9A681CF](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0xCF044E72D9A681CF&fingerprint=on&hash=on&exact=on&op=vindex)
