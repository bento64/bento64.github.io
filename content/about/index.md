# `$ whoami`

I'm bento64, or you may feel a little more familiar with my previous username wello6143.

My actual name is Nhan Dang (in common Western languages naming arrangement). `Dang Trung Nhan` is my full name in Vietnamese arrangement. So that `Trung` are my middle name, while `Nhan` and `Dang` is my first/given name and last/surname, respectively.

I'm 18 years old, prounous are he/him/his and I'm currently a computer engineering undergraduate student of College of Engineering, Can Tho University.

My hobbies are study English, learn about how computer works, contribute to [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) as well as write things about it, tinker around with software and computer networking. Most of the time those circles around a thing called [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). My favorite Linux distribution is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).

I mostly spend my free time doing mentioned hobbies above. I rarely playing computer games now, but if I do, it's Minecraft (still my most favorite one). I enjoy reading manga on my phone when I'm away from my laptop at home, the genres are rom-com and adventure.
