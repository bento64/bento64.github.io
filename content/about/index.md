# `$ whoami`

I'm bento64, or you may feel a little more familiar with my previous username wello6143.

My actual name is Nhan Dang (in common Western languages naming arrangement). `Dang Trung Nhan` is my full name in Vietnamese arrangement. So that `Trung` are my middle name, while `Nhan` and `Dang` is my first/given name and last/surname, respectively.

I'm 18 years old, prounouns are he/him/his and I'm currently a computer engineering undergraduate student of College of Engineering, Can Tho University.

My hobbies are study English, learn about how computer works, contribute to [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) as well as write things about it, tinker around with software and computer networking. Most of the time those circles around a thing called [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). My favorite Linux distribution is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).

I mostly spend my free time doing mentioned hobbies above. I rarely playing computer games now, but if I do, it's Minecraft (still my most favorite one). I enjoy reading manga on my phone when I'm away from my laptop at home, the genres are rom-com and adventure.

More information about me is available in these subpages:

## Notes when contacting me:
1. Don't ask to ask, just ask. If you ask to ask, I will ignore you until you bring your question up.
2. Don't spam me for any reason. I will try my best to reply you as soon as possible if your concern touches me.
3. If you want to use email with me...
    * please write them in a proper format.
    * you **must** include an understandable subject. I will not accept and ignore any email with no subject.
    * please don't attach unnecessary file. Email isn't designed for entainment purposes.
    * please write in required language.
    * please don't be rude under any circumstance.
    * you should use PGP to sign/encrypt email with me. This is optional, but highly recommended for the sake of security and authenticity.
    * never ask me to solve your own homework/project or asking "stupid" questions that only take you a "googling" away.

Failure in following these notes will result from being ignored to permanently banned to contact with me in any way possible. I don't have time to linger around with you.

But don't you worry to write something to me. As long as you don't annoy me, I will warmly welcome your message.
